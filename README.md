Tennis Shop E-Commerce (ASP.NET Core MVC & Entity Framework)

Description:

This project implements a fully functional e-commerce store for tennis equipment, leveraging ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework. It was developed as a project defence application for the C# Web (ASP.NET Advanced) module (February-April 2024) at SoftWare University, Sofia.

Technical Stack:

ASP.NET Core MVC: Employs the Model-View-Controller pattern for a well-organized and maintainable codebase.

Entity Framework: Provides data persistence and object-relational mapping for seamless database interaction.

Visual Studio 2022 ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages) Template and .NET 6: Streamlined project setup.

Inspiration & Resources:

Lectures and Workshops by Stamo Petkov (February-April 2024) and Kristian Ivanov (June-July 2023) at SoftWare University.

ASP.NET Core Template: The well-structured template by Nikolay Kostov, https://github.com/NikolayIT/ASP.NET-Core-Template.git, served as a foundational base for this project.
